It originated as part of the bachelor thesis 'Feature-based Estimation of 3D Point Clouds with Forward-looking Imaging Sonar' at ETH Zürich from Bastian Schildknecht in 2020. It is now further being developed by Tethys Robotics and ETH Zürich but any other contributions are also very welcome.

## Currently Supported Sonar Modes
