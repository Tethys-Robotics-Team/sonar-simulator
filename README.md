# Sonar Simulator
A general purpose sonar simulation tool for research purposes built with Unity.

## Introduction
This is a general purpose sonar simulation tool intended for research applications. It originated as part of the bachelor thesis 'Feature-based Estimation of 3D Point Clouds with Forward-looking Imaging_Sonar' at ETH Zürich from Bastian Schildknecht in 2020. It is now further being developed by Tethys Robotics and ETH Zürich but any contributions are welcome.

## Currently Supported Sonar Modes
- Multibeam Imaging Sonar (Similar to the blueprint subsea Oculus devices)

## Usage
You may use this software for any purposes permitted by the attached MIT license. Academic research in particular is encouraged and any contributions and improvements to the software are very welcome.
